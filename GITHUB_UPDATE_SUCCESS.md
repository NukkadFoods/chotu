## 🎯 **KEY FEATURES NOW ON GITHUB:**

### **1. Intelligent Context Analysis**
```python
# Before: Generic question
"Could you provide more information about chrome?"

# After: Context-aware intelligence  
"Chrome is currently open. Do you want me to close it?"
```

### **2. Confidence-Based Decision Making**
- **90-100%**: Direct execution
- **75-89%**: Good understanding with minor assumptions
- **50-74%**: Educated guess with confirmation
- **Below 50%**: Intelligent clarification

### **3. RAM/ROM/Chat History Analysis**
- Analyzes recent interactions (RAM)
- Recognizes user patterns (ROM)  
- Uses conversation context (Chat)
- Makes intelligent inferences

### **4. Smart Clarification System**
- Context-aware options instead of generic questions
- Safety warnings when appropriate
- Current state awareness
- Pattern-based suggestions
