## 🚀 **KEY CAPABILITIES CHOTU NOW HAS:**

### 1. **Autonomous Code Generation**
```python
# When user asks for unknown capability:
user: "create a wifi speed test tool"

# Chotu automatically:
1. Analyzes what's missing
2. Generates Python code using GPT-4
3. Validates syntax and security
4. Tests in sandbox environment
5. Registers new tool in capability registry
6. Makes it available immediately
```

### 2. **Learning from Failures**
```python
# When a tool fails:
chotu.learn_from_failure(
    tool_name="old_tool",
    error="timeout error",
    user_intent="check network speed"
)

# Chotu creates improved version automatically
```

### 3. **Capability Gap Detection**
- Automatically identifies missing functionality
- Suggests new tools based on usage patterns
- Recommends improvements for low-performing tools

### 4. **Safe Autonomous Operation**
- Sandbox execution prevents harmful code
- Permission system with safety levels
- Automatic backups and rollback capability
- Audit logging for all generated code

### 5. **Performance Monitoring**
- Tracks success rates for all tools
- Monitors tool usage patterns
- Optimizes learning based on effectiveness
- Health scoring for system stability

## 🔧 **CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:**

```ini
[learning]
max_auto_tools = 50          # Maximum tools Chotu can create
min_confidence = 0.7         # Quality threshold
safety_mode = 1              # Enhanced safety checks
auto_learning_enabled = 1    # Enable/disable auto-learning

[gpt]
model = gpt-4               # Primary model for generation
temperature = 0.3           # Code generation creativity

[sandbox]
timeout = 10                # Execution time limits
memory_limit = 512MB        # Resource constraints
network_access = 0          # Isolated testing
```

## 📈 **LEARNING WORKFLOW:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B{Known Capability?}
    B -->|No| C[Analyze Requirements]
    C --> D[Generate Code with GPT-4]
    D --> E[Validate & Test]
    E --> F{Safe & Working?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Register Tool]
    F -->|No| H[Learn from Failure]
    G --> I[Available Immediately]
    H --> D
    B -->|Yes| J[Execute Existing Tool]
    J --> K{Success?}
    K -->|No| H
```

## 🎯 **TESTING THE SYSTEM:**

### Test 1: Unknown Capability
```python
# User asks for something new
result = chotu.handle_unknown_command("create system performance monitor")

# Expected: Chotu generates new tool automatically
```

### Test 2: Learning from Failure
```python
# Existing tool fails
result = chotu.handle_tool_failure(
    "old_tool", 
    "permission denied", 
    "check disk usage"
)

# Expected: Improved tool with proper permissions
```

### Test 3: Manual Learning
```python
# Force learning new capability
result = chotu.manual_learn_capability("pdf merger tool", force=True)

# Expected: New PDF tool created and registered
```
