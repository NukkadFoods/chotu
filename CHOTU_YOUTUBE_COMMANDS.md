## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Voice Recognition**: Chotu listens for "Hey Chotu" wake word
2. **Command Processing**: Your voice command is processed by the NLP system
3. **MCP Server**: Command is routed to the MCP server
4. **Enhanced Automation**: Uses our stealth browser system to:
   - Force desktop YouTube (no mobile redirects)
   - Find search box reliably with multiple selectors
   - Handle ads and popups automatically
   - Start video playback without detection
