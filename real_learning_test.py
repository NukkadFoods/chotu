This email was generated by your improved autonomous learning system after it detected and fixed the broken localhost SMTP email tool. The system has now learned to create Gmail-compatible email functionality autonomously.

Best regards,
Your Self-Improving Chotu AI System 🤖

P.S. This demonstrates true autonomous learning - detecting failures and creating solutions independently!
